For the carousel it ends up allowing us to both manually and automatically change slides with something like the right carousel-control, as it affects listed and named variables like the ones I kept as "#myCarousel". What's written inside this bit doesn't seem to affect the outside appearance, so I can edit what is necessary without breaking the code.-->

      <h2>More Information About What I Like and My Favorites</h2>
      <p>
        Video games are one of my favorite pass times, and I like quite a few. I
        primarily like shooters and soulslike games, with my favorite game being
        Destiny 2. Don't get your hopes up though, the game is a loose cannon
      </p>

      >
      <!--The first video I've placed in, the video is chosen to have captions to make it so those who are deaf can read them if interested-->
      <p>
        For my other favorite pass time, it would be digital art. It could be 2d
        or 3d, I love both quite a bit. But among them, my favorite art would be
        anime art, or in other words manga. Though I'm a bit darker on how I do
        it. I plan on making my own little story someday.
