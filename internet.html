      <h2>Internet, Encoding, Encryption. What my major has taught me.</h2>
      <p>
        We all know the internet, but there's a lot more to it, like how it
        protects our data. When it comes to encoding, simply put, it is the
        world of binary and base 10 coding, what we use to make websites and
        programs. What encryption would be is hides our data when we send things
        like messages, and protects
      </p>

      <h2>Internet and How It Travels Key Concepts</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Networks: Systems that are connected or tied together that lets people
          exchange data with each other. It could be phones, video games, or
          wifi.
        </li>
        <li>
          Protocols: Systems that protects our private data when we give our
          info to a website, encrypting it so only the website will get it. A
          known one is HTTPS, something we will go over later on.
        </li>
        <!--Continue Changing protocols-->
        <li>
          Physical Connections: This would be objects like cables, wires, and
          devices like wifi routers. The point of them is to send messages and
          data, and connect people all over the world. These objects can also
          make data travel faster, and more secure since they can be encrypted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Packet Switching: Our data and messages are broken into chunks called
          "Data packets". These packets carry bits of data, and are easier to
          send since they can take different network routes, and can come in any
          order to their address. When your data arrives, the packages are put
          back together to show the full data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Routing: The many paths our packages can take to get to where they are
          need to be, even if one path doesn't work. A good one would be home
          wifi routers, since someone elses data can use your router and others
          to find their way the right location. If one router isn't working,
          then there are other routers they can use as a path.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reliability: Protects our data well, and keeps us safe. There are ways
          your data can still be at risk, but these help a lot.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What is Encoding?</h2>
      <p>
        Binary: A coding system with only 1 and 0, where each unit is called a
        bit, and you can have a total of 8 together. 1 equals on while 0 equals
        off in the code world, and depending on which are 1 or 0, equal
        different letters and numbers they were assigned to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decimal: An alternate to binary, it can also be called base 10. We keep
        track of data by tallying up to 9, if what we are counting goes past
        that, than we move one place to the left and keep counting.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASCII: The method we use to turn binary into readable text. Each value
        for binary is already associated with a different letter, number or
        symbol. Counting all values, there are about 255 different values that
        can be translated
      </p>

      <h2>What is Encryption?</h2>
      <p>
        Encryption Purpose: Meant to protect private data and messages sent
        out/recieved, making it unusable for hackers and cyber thieves. It turn
        what we call plain text, which is letter and numbers we type, into
        cyphertext, which is text hackers can't read and have to unscramble.
      </p>
      <p>
        Symmetric Encryption: It is a type of security method that uses the same
        key to both lock and unlock your data. It's used in storing your data,
        sending it to the cloud storage, or for credit card payments. It also is
        the faster way to login.

      <p>
        Assymmetric Encryption: Unlike the other method, this uses two different
        keys, a public key and a private key. The public key can be used by
        anyone to send and lock data, but a only the person who is supposed to
        get the data has a private key. Only the person with a private key can
        unlock and see. It's used for emails, signatures, secure websites, and
        authenticators.

      <h2>How does HTTPS Use Encryption?</h2>
      <p>
        HTTPS uses TLS and SSL protocols, which protect and encrypt data. SSL
        was the old way to protect data, but TLS was a newer one that added on
        to improve security, having a private and public access key. These keys
        would protect your private data whenever you try to go to a website from
        your browser. How? Simple, they encrypt the data you send out and lock
        it, and make it so the person who is supposed to get the message is the
        only one with the key to decrypt and unlock the data.

      <h2>Methods to Protect Online Data</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          VPN can hide your location and prevent hackers from tracking you
        </li>
        <li>
          Use password managers to make strong passwords, auto fill your
          passwords to keep them from tracking the buttons you press, and make
          hackers work to break in.
        </li>
        <li>
          Antivirus can get rid of virus and trackers that hackers use to steal
          your data, good if you don't know you have a virus
        </li>
        <li>
          Authenticator makes it so you get push alarms to tell you about any
          login tries, hackers have to verify with YOU to login and makes
          password keys they need, but only you have.
        </li>
        <li>
          Firewalls block out and filter shady connections, websites, and giving
          of data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be cautious of links and emails you don't know, attachments are a huge
          red flag
