      <h2>Internet, Encoding, Encryption. What my major has taught me.</h2>
      <p>
        We all know the internet, but there's a lot more to it, like how it
        protects our data. When it comes to encoding, simply put, it is the world of binary and base 10 coding, what we use to make websites and programs. What encryption would be is 
        hides our data when we send things like messages, and protects

      <h2>What is Encoding?</h2>
      <p>
        Binary: A coding system with only 1 and 0, where each unit is called a
        bit, and you can have a total of 8 together. 1 equals on while 0 equals
        off in the code world, and depending on which are 1 or 0, equal
        different letters and numbers they were assigned to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decimal: An alternate to binary, it can also be called base 10. We keep
        track of data by tallying up to 9, if what we are counting goes past
        that, than we move one place to the left and keep counting.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASCII: The method we use to turn binary into readable text. Each value
        for binary is already associated with a different letter, number or
        symbol. Counting all values, there are about 255 different values that
        can be translated
